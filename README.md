### About the project

The project Evenex was made on account of my final year graduation project. The project received great reviews and appreciation form moderators. 

Evenex is a an event (meet-up) management website where basically new meetups can be created and people can participate in them accordingly.
Evenex is a platform where many event organizers can come and give details about their events and gain good participants because all the events will be on single platform so no need to search outside. Participants can browse and participate.

Evenex has three main entities: **Admin, Event organizer, Event participants.**

👉 Event organizer can register to the platform and gain access to the dashboard in backend in which he can login and make events.

👉 Event organizer can give all the details of his event in the respective category including brochure, list of speakers, description, FAQ's, Date and time of the event. Add to calendar feature.

👉 Once people starts enrolling he has full freedom to stop and start the enrollment process. 

👉 They can observe the enrolled participants in the backend. Also they can download the report of the participants enrolled in PDF format for reference and for attendance purpose

**Features of Event Participants:**
